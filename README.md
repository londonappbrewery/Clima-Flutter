# Development Journal

### Dev Sprint #1
After seeing this project on The App Brewery's Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp, I created a fork and started working on it. While working on the project, I had to change some of the code written in the course because some features used in the course were outdated.
I changed,
-the Geolocator package to 7.6.2 and used newer features of it.
-API services of openweathermap.org to a newer version.
